# Brick-Building Simulator

You can try the demo [here](https://www.hyperstudios.de/Brick-Building-Simulator.html).

You can download this software [here](https://github.com/DerHyper/Brick-Building-Simulator/releases/).

## What was this software made for?
This software was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis: _"Development of a Brick-Building Simulator"_.

This is a serious game where you can build constructs using digital building blocks. The focus lies on digitizing the serious play method used for analyzing scientific theses at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf.
