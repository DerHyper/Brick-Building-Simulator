# How to build the Brick-Building Simulator
If you want to use the Brick-Building Simulator on a platform of your choice, you first need to build it. Some Builds can already be found at [Builds](/../KlemmSim/Builds/)

### 1. Open the project in the Unity Editor
For more details on how to open the project in the Unity Editor, please look [here](Open-In-Unity.md).

### 2. Open the Build Settings
On the outermost menu bar, select **File > Build Settings ...**

### 3. Select the platform you want to build
In the Submenu **Platform** select the platform you want to export to. When selecting *Windows, Mac, Linux* the target platform can be selected on the right.

**Currently, tested platforms:** 
+ Windows 64-bit
+ WebGL


**Note:** If your desired platform is not supported, you first have to install it via the Unity hub. Â 
(**Installs > *unity_version* > Add modules**)


### 4. Switch platform and build
If you have not already, switch the platform. This can be done my clicking on the button **Switch Platform**. 

Now you can select where to build the project by pressing the button **Build** or **Build and Run**. Other Builds can be found at [KlemmSim/Builds/](/../KlemmSim/Builds/)
