If the version is not listed, you can find it in the [Unity download archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).

### 3. Get the Brick-Building-Simulator project
At the home directory [Brick-Building-Simulator/](/../Brick-Building-Simulator/) you can either clone, fork or download the project. For further information on how to do that, please see [this](https://docs.github.com/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) article from GitHub.
